**AOE2 Fight Simulator**

You can see it live here: http://zephni.com/aoe2/fightsim

This script will show a simulation of a fight between two units. Including bonus damage, unit defence and attack rate,
it is however still in development and many more units (and possibly features) are due to be added.

If you have any ideas please let me know.
